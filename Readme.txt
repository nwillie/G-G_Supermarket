This is the front-end development of G-G Supermarket's website. 
Creating this, I employed:
1. html (language)
2. css (language)
3. A bit of java.script (language)
4. Bootstrap framework (framework)

On the main html page, I program the website to:
1. showcase the qualities of our brand.
2. receive questions and provide accessible means of contact. 
3. show the different departments we have in G-G Supermarket and their various roles. 
4. clearly show my contact and email for various customer concerns.
5. direct customers who'd like to make online purchase through the process (ordering, payment and transportation) without any stress.
